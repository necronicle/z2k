// Package decision classifies probe outcomes into engine states.
//
// Current policy:
//
//	DNS failed              → Ignore  (domain doesn't resolve — not ours)
//	TCP:443 failed          → Hot     (reachable name, unreachable host → likely blocked)
//	TLS handshake failed    → Hot     (TLS interception / blackhole → likely blocked)
//	HTTP cutoff             → Hot     (TLS up but stream severed mid-response — L7 DPI signature)
//	Everything OK           → Ignore  (direct path works — no need to tunnel)
//
// HTTPOK is tri-state: nil means the probe didn't run the HTTP stage (older
// remote prober, manual call site that skipped) — fall back to TCP+TLS
// verdict only. ptr(false) means we tried and got severed; ptr(true) means
// we read a real response OR the server actively rejected with a typed
// TLS alert (mTLS challenge etc., handled inside prober — see
// prober.IsServerReachable). Either way the path is reachable, so Ignore.
